<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

* This project was developed specifically for stores like: [Specsavers](https://www.specsavers.co.za/). After noticing that they don't have an online 'try it on' system for their specs/glasses. We decided to work on a system that will deliver instant feedback using [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) for facial detection

_For more information, please refer to the [Cloudinary Docs](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/)_
